## The Company

We are Liberis and we believe in helping UK companies to be successful.

We're doing our bit to bring a breath of fresh air to the industry, by helping to ensure the SME market thrives by having access to funds they need, when they need them.

We are a dynamic and fast paced company and are looking for a Senior Developer to join our new development team.

At Liberis we are building a business finance application & management platform and data products, to create a data driven ecosystem that enables small businesses to gain easy access to finance.

We're looking for big thinkers with small egos to join our vision to transform business finance.

## The Team

This is a brand new team in 2015, specifically formed to revolutionise the way Liberis does business and we are looking for big thinkers, innovators and dedicated developers to explore the possibilities of what we can do.

We develop along DevOps principles, which means you will be responsible for your work from requirements, through dev, testing, deployment and into maintenance. Everything we do is wrapped in tests and everything is automated when it should be.

Everyone in the Liberis Labs team is active in the tech community, whether it's attending or running user groups, writing blogs or contributing Open Source Software; the culture of the team is there to encourage continuous learning and development and bring that back into the business. In turn the business will provide support, through high performance kit, training, conferences, monitors and whatever tools you need to get the job done

Because this team is new and independent, but our business is well established, you will get the best of both worlds, a start-up mentality and atmosphere where you will have a huge voice in shaping the way we do things but with all the perks and support of being part of a bigger company.
