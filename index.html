            <h3 class="ui header">We keep it simple</h3>
            <p>Simple is very hard to achieve, but through rigorous separation of concerns, a gazillion micro-services each focussed on their own jobs, and 100% test coverage across all our units and systems, simple is what what we get.</p>

             <h3 class="ui header">We're pretty open</h3>
			<p> Some of the stuff we do is secret, but a lot isn't. Just as we pull from the Open Source Community to build our systems, we like to <a href="https://github.com/liberislabs/">share the awesome stuff we do</a>, expecially when we are building sweet services around other peoples software. Sharing is Caring</p>

            <p>Awesome is the default setting at Liberis Labs and nothing less is expected. This is reflected in the code we write, the applications we create, the team lunches we enjoy or the banter</p>

            <p>Instead of focusing on content creation and hard work, we have learned how to master the art of doing nothing by providing massive amounts of whitespace and generic content that can seem massive, monolithic and worth your attention.</p>
